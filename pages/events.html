          <p>Bingo Bedlem<br>
          This event took 3 hours.<br><br>
          From this event I intended to increase my confidence in speeking in a large proup of perople I didn't know.<br><br>
          The actual outcome of the nights events didn't lead to this growth. Instead it was a fairly uneventful night. Though it was a fairly fun experience.</p>

          <p>During the digital horizens week there was many events.<br><br>
            Some of these events were:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Tuesday, 1 hour-talks on the use of computer tech being used to help people with learning disabilities.</li>
                <li>Wednesday, 1 hour-an employability talk about what what students can do to boost their skills at being employed</li>
            </ul><br><br>
            In these talks I've learned about the studies being conducted in similar fields, how they are apllying this in the real world and about how to improve my online presence and personal skills when it comes to future opertunities.

         <p>Bletchly park<br>
         This event took 8 hours.<br><br>
         On this trip we visited bletchly park. The home of where the enigma code was broken.<br><br>
         This trip made me aprechiate the scale of the operation that Happened there. Additioanlly, it was fun to see the efforts put in to try and restore this faclity as all records and physical evidence of the operation should've been destroyed.</p>
